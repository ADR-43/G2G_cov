\title{Log-Likelihood for G2G Model with Time-Varying Covariates}
\usage{
G2G_varying_LL(par, data_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{Numeric vector of parameters. First two elements are r and alpha
(shape and rate parameters), remaining elements are covariate coefficients.}

\item{data_df}{Data frame with columns:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Subject identifier}
  \item{time}{Time point for each observation}
  \item{status}{Event indicator (0 = no occurence, 1 = event occurred)}
  \item{...}{Time-varying covariates (remaining columns)}
}}
}
\value{
Scalar value of the negative log-likelihood
}
\description{
Internal function that computes the negative log-likelihood for the G2G model
with time-varying covariates. Used by the optimization routine.
