# R estimation code for "Incorporating Time-Varying Covariates in a Simple Mixture Model for Discrete-Time Duration Data"

Pete Fader and Bruce Hardie provide a technical note https://brucehardie.com/notes/037/ on incorporating time-varying covariates for a discrete-time duration mixture model. It is an extention to the (shifted) Beta-Geometric Distribution, now with covariates. The authors call it G2G+covariates model.

However, a code on how to estimate this model is not available.

I created the MLE estimation code using R.

Please contact me (kaloklee@gmail.com) if you have any questions or comments.
