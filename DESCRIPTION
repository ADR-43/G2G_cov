Description: Implements the Grassia(II)-Geometric (G2G) distribution model with 
    time-varying covariates for discrete-time survival analysis. Provides maximum 
    likelihood estimation following Fader and Hardie's methodology for incorporating 
    covariates in discrete-time duration models. Supports both static and 
    time-varying covariates using person-period formatted data.
